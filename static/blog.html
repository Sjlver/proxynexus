                        Hey everyone. I'd like to announce Proxy Nexus, a website I've been working on the last few days. It makes high quality proxies using <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/LepcisMagna" target="_blank" rel="noopener">/u/LepcisMagna's</a> scans and images from the Downfall cards, unchanged from the print-and-play pdfs.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        You can enter a card list, a decklist URL from NetrunnerDB or select an official set. When picking any of the three Core sets, you can choose between single set or a full playset. Also, whenever a flippable ID is selected (Sync and Biotech), the back images are also included.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clicking "Download PDF" currently brings up the browser's print panel, which lets you save to PDF or print directly. Make sure all the cards have loaded beforehand and that the margins are narrow enough so that 9 cards fit per game.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've made some enhancements to the scanned images. First, I applied the despeckle enhancement from Gimp to all images. I also use ImageMagick's mogrify tool to slightly brighten and enhance the colors of the cards. The command I used: "mogrify -modulate 105,105". <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sGu4rih" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Have a look here for comparison.</a> I believe these enhancements improve the print quality significantly, but I'm open to feedback.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My exams are coming soon, so I've gotta take a break, but I plan on adding the following improvements
                        <ul>
                            <li>Generate PDF on server end.</li>
                            <li>Reduce image sizes with minimal quality loss.</li>
                            <li>Provide option to select available alt art for cards that have it.</li>
                            <li>Provide option to download a zip file of image files ready for printing at MPC (makeplayingcards.com). The images will include a black border. I will also NOT include any Nisei cards selected in this option, and will prompt users to buy a set from the Nisei marketplaces to support them.</li>
                            <li>Make suggestions when printing certain cards to include others. Eg, when printing Rebirth, ask whether to include other IDs in the same faction. Similar idea with DJ Fenris. When printing Adam, ask whether to include copies of the directives.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm open to suggestions on functionality and style.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope this makes it easier for newer players to get into the game and for others who are unable to find missing sets. Thanks for checking this out!
